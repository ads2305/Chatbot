## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project presents an interactive chatbot interface inspired by traditional Kerala culture, featuring a humorous “Malayali uncle” persona. It aims to engage users through witty Malayalam dialogues and culturally relatable animated visuals, creating an entertaining and regionally grounded digital experience.

## THE PROBLEM

Most chatbot interfaces today lack cultural personality and emotional relatability. Our project solves this by designing a regionally inspired Malayalam-style AI bot that brings humor, familiarity, and local flavor to digital conversations—turning a typically bland user experience into something entertaining and engaging.

## THE SOLUTION

We developed a culturally themed AI chatbot interface that mimics the tone, expressions, and personality of a typical humorous Malayalam-speaking “uncle” character. By combining regional language flair, animated visuals, and a responsive design, the solution offers users a fun, emotionally engaging, and relatable interaction experience—making digital communication more lively and locally resonant.
